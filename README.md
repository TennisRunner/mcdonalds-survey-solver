## How it works
It spams the next button until it gives you the confirmation code

## Alternative solution
The survey validation code is 7 digits long.
As a guess, the first 5 digits are a increasing unix like timestamp and the last 2 digits is the number that appears after the KS#.
Usually the number is 13, but you should check it anyways.

So as long as you make a believable 7 digit number such as 5925313. 
You can just write a made up number into the validation line.
